This Kogito Serverless Workflow project contains a sample workflow definition as described in the [Quarkus Kogito guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/kogito).
The goal is to showcase automatic REST endpoint codegen, based on the content of the model.
The `greet.sw.json` workflow will greet users in different languages based on the input.

You can reference the [full guide on the Quarkus website](https://quarkus.io/guides/kogito).
