This Kogito DMN Quarkus codestart contains a sample DMN model as described in the [Quarkus Kogito DMN guide](https://quarkus.io/version/2.13/guides/kogito-dmn).
The goal is to showcase automatic REST endpoint codegen, based on the content of the model.
The `pricing.dmn` DMN model calculates a base price quotation based on some criteria provided as input.

You can reference the [full guide on the Quarkus website](https://quarkus.io/version/2.13/guides/kogito-dmn).
