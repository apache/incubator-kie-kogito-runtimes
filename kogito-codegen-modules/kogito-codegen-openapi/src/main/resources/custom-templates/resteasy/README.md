These are the custom templates used by the OpenAPI Generator Tool to create the REST client code. We've modified some of
them to play along our required features.

If you've ever need to modify these files, please check
their [documentation](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/templating).

The templates we are likely to override are the [RestEasy](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/main/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/Java/libraries/resteasy) and [Java client](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/main/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/Java) ones.
