# Kogito Gradle Plugin

This Gradle plugin aims to manage the code generation assets during the compile time of a Kogito application.

Supported frameworks of this plugin are:
- Apache KIE plain Java projects;
- Apache KIE Springboot based projects;

During the execution, the plugin will discover all Apache KIE assets, which are:
- Decisions (DMN);
- Predictions (PMML);
- Processes (BPMN);
- Rules (DRL)

and will generate and compile all the Java Classes auto-generated by the Kogito Codegen layer
(see the `kogito-coden-modules`) that are mandatory for a correct Kogito application operation.

## How to use it

In your Kogito project root `settings.gradle.kts` file, add the following plugin management declaration:

```kts      
pluginManagement {
  repositories {
    maven {
      val repoLocation = ...
      url = uri(repoLocation)
    }
  }
  resolutionStrategy {
    eachPlugin {
      if (requested.id.namespace == "org.kie.kogito.gradle") {
        useModule("org.kie.kogito:kogito-gradle-plugin:${requested.version}")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In your Kogito project root `build.gradle.kts` file, add the following plugins declaration: 

```kts
plugins {
  id("org.kie.kogito.gradle") version "..." (the current kogito version)
}
```

Please notice that `org.kie.kogito.gradle` is the Gradle Plugin ID.

## HOT-RELOAD
Gradle supports continuous build execution. Enabling it vary depending on the framework used.

## CAVEAT
* the plugin [pom](./pom.xml) must contains exactly the same commented lines in the same position
* the plugin [pom](./pom.xml) can not declare any parent: all the properties (and eventual dependencies) have to be defined in the pom itself
