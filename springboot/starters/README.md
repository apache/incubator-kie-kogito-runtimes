# Kogito SpringBoot Starters

In this module you will find all
the [SpringBoot Starters](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/main/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-starters)
provided by the Kogito community.

Before jumping into the starters, consider adding the Kogito SpringBoot BOM to your project:

```xml

<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
      <artifactId>kogito-springboot-bom</artifactId>
      <version>${version.kogito}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Replace `${version.kogito}` with the [current version of Kogito](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes/releases).

## Kogito SpringBoot Starter

The `kogito-spring-boot-starter` is an all-in-one descriptor for projects that needs every Business Automation engine
provided by Kogito. It includes Decisions, Rules, Process, Predictions and the Serverless Workflow implementation.

If your project has all these assets, or you're just trying Kogito and want a quick way of getting started, this is the
starter you need. For a more granular approach, consider the specific starters (or a combination of them). See below in
the following sections how to use them.

To add this starter to your project:

```xml

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
    <artifactId>kogito-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

> If you are planning to use Serverless Workflow with events, consider adding the `kogito-serverless-workflow-spring-boot-starter` as well to the project. This starter will include CloudEvents support required by Serverless Workflows.

## Kogito Decisions SpringBoot Starter

  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Kogito Processes SpringBoot Starter

  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Please note that this starter will auto-include the [CloudEvents](../addons/cloudevents)
and [Kafka](../addons/events/kafka) addons to the project as well
for [eventing processing](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/0.6.x/specification.md#Event-Definition)
.
