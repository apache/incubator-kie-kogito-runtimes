# Kogito Source Files Add-on

The Kogito Source Files Add-on adds the capability of listing and downloading source files to Kogito projects. See

This add-on isn't supposed to be used by end-users, if not needed for internal integrations, since it can be a potential security breach for some users' use cases.
